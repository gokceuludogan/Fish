# FISH

FISH is a file sharing system allowing its users to share media files (such as MP3 and
images) on the Internet. Since it has been started, it has known a huge success, in such an
extent that some universities have been forced to forbid their students to use FISH on their
networks. The system is developed in two versions which are client-server version and
peer-to-peer version.
